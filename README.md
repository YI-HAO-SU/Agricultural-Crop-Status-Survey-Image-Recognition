# Agricultural-Crop-Status-Survey-Image-Recognition

The agricultural crop status survey operation involves personnel capturing images on-site with cameras and documenting the details. 
The extensive and fragmented nature of agricultural regions in our country, with numerous plots, results in a vast amount of image data. 
Converting this data into information usable for management system operations requires significant human effort and time. 
As AI technology continues to advance, image interpretation tasks have matured in recent years, making them highly suitable for integration into the agricultural crop status survey workflow. 
This integration can expedite the acquisition of necessary information for agricultural authorities.

While there are comprehensive AI datasets in areas such as daily life, industry, and healthcare, the agricultural domain is relatively lacking. 
Meeting the future demand for AI technology in smart agriculture will require substantial investment in professional manpower for the collection and analysis of agricultural-related information.
Therefore, the challenges presented in this competition aim to assist students in understanding the application needs of agricultural datasets and image recognition in the agricultural industry. 
It also aims to cultivate students' experience and technical capabilities in using AI technology for image recognition in the agricultural sector.
